## Project Objective
To build a travel application that contains a form which obtains information on user's upcoming trip - destination and departure date. With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Weatherbit and Pixabay, the app then displays weather and an image of the location on that given date.

- installed webpack and webpack cli
- added babel
- installed html webpack plugin
- installed clean webpack plugin
- installed webpack dev server
- installed sass loaders: style-loader node-sass css-loader sass-loader
- set up the MeaningCloud API
